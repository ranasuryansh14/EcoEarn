**An innovative and sustainable step towards a green future**

## Description
EcoEarn partners with eco-conscious companies to promote the use of recyclable products, with a focus on eco-friendly bags. Our main business model revolves around encouraging customers to adopt sustainable shopping habits by using our recyclable bags. Every bag comes with a QR code that can be scanned to earn Eco-Points, which users can redeem for various coupons and discounts at affiliated companies.

Through our collaborations, we incentivize the use of eco-friendly products while providing added value to customers. As companies adopt EcoEarn bags, we foster a greener approach to shopping and reward customers with eco-points to promote continuous engagement with sustainable practices.
